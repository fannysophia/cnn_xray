# CNN for Surgical Outcome Prediction in Cervical Spinal Cord Injury

This project explores the use of **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to predict surgical outcomes in patients with cervical spinal cord injuries based on **preoperative X-ray imaging**.  
The model performs a **binary classification**:  
- **Success** – surgery led to positive recovery outcomes  
- **No success** – surgery did not achieve the intended outcome  

Final model accuracy: **~80%**

## Motivation
Accurate prediction of surgical outcomes can help clinicians:
- Support decision-making before surgery  
- Improve patient counseling and expectation management  
- Lay the foundation for AI-assisted personalized medicine in spinal surgery
-
