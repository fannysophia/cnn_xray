This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict surgical outcomes in patients with cervical spinal cord injuries from preoperative X-ray imaging. 
The model classifies patients into Success - surgery led to positive recovery outcomes - and No success â€“ surgery did not achieve the intended outcome.
